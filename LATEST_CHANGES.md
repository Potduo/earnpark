## Authentication Status

### Current Status: NOT CONFIGURED

**You cannot create accounts yet** because Supabase has not been set up.

### What's Being Used

- ✅ **Supabase Authentication** (NOT a demo system)
- ❌ **Environment variables NOT configured**
- ❌ **Cannot sign up or log in until Supabase is set up**

### How to Enable Authentication

1. Follow the `SUPABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` to create your Supabase project
2. Add your Supabase URL and API key to the `.env` file
3. Restart the dev server
4. Authentication will work immediately

See `AUTHENTICATION_SETUP.md` for complete details.

## Database Status

### ✅ Using Supabase (NOT Bolt Database)

All database operations use Supabase:
- User authentication → Supabase Auth
- User dashboard data → Supabase `user_dashboard_data` table
- Withdrawal requests → Supabase `withdrawal_requests` table
- Chat messages → Supabase (when configured)

The database tables are already created via migrations. They just need Supabase to be configured to start working.

**Q: How am I able to create an account?**
**A:** You can't yet. You need to set up Supabase first by following the `SUPABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md`.

**Q: For the database, I want to use Supabase and not bolt database.**
**A:** ✅ Already done! The app uses Supabase for everything. There's no Bolt database - only Supabase.
