## Important Notes

### Email Verification
By default, Supabase requires email verification. You have two options:
1. **Production (Recommended):** Keep email verification enabled and configure SMTP
2. **Testing:** Temporarily disable email verification in Supabase settings

See `SUPABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions.

### Netlify Forms
Forms will only work after deployment to Netlify. In local development, form submissions will fail silently (by design).

### Team Photos
The current team photos are placeholders from Pexels. Replace them with your actual team photos by updating the URLs in `src/pages/About.tsx`.
